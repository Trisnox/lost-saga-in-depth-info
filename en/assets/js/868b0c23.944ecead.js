If you wish to contribute/suggest/fix (typo, incorrect information, missing information), you can contact me via `discord: trisnox`, submit [pull request](https://github.com/Trisnox/lost-saga-in-depth-info/pulls), or submit [issue](https://github.com/Trisnox/lost-saga-in-depth-info/issues). For discord, you can contact me through DMs or from a discord server directly, I urge you to not bring this subject on LSO Valofe discord server, thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\nSmall lore, everything starts where I had thought of extracting models from Lost Saga, that I later [turn it into animation](https://youtu.be/DLYl9QIcmUM).  After some though, almost all resource are available on that archive, this includes: hero data, gear, shop, PvP/PvE mode, and many more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis file contains detailed information about said item, I was surprised by just looking at it knowing that no one knew about such information.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance: scientist helm lvl 3 doesn\'t give you damage bonus buff, but rather cause your attack to inflict a poison debuff when landing a hit on enemy. This poison lasts for .1s and every .05s enemy loses health for 2%.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot even developer/GM would give such information, hence why I create this wiki to provide information to all Lost Saga player."}]}')}}]);
